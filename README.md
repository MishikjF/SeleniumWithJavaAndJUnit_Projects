# SeleniumWithJavaAndJUnit_Projects
My first Selenium projects

On these projects, I worked through March 2022.
The QAC_POM project is my first Maven project using the Page Object Model. The test scripts were written for http://qacourse.churlinoski.mk/.
In the puzzle project, I practiced tricky automation techniques on the website http://uitestingplayground.com/.
